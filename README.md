# Numerically computing the Nash equilibrium strategy for two questions on my lockdown quiz.

Q4. True or false, no one will answer true to this question. (1 point)
Q5. Did you get the previous question correct? (2 points)

Turns out there is a simple intuitive solution, so numerical solution was overkill.

Choose True/No with probability such that if everyone uses that probability, there is 1/2 probability that someone says True (depends on number of players).

Choose between False/No and False/Yes with equal probability.
